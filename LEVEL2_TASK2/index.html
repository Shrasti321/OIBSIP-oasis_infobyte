            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October 1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist and also a politician leader, who later became the 11th President of India. He played an important role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons program.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu.In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.</p>

                        <h4>Famed Inventor</h4>
                        <p>On graduation from the University of Madras in 1960, APJ Abdul Kalam returned to the Defence Research and Development organisation Organisation as a scientist (DRDO). He began his career by creating a tiny hovercraft, however his position with the DRDO did not persuade him. APJ Abdul Kalam was moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969 as the project head of India’s first Satellite Launch Vehicle, which successfully launched the Rohini satellite into relatively near orbit in July 1980.
                        Raja Ramanna also invited APJ Abdul Kalam to see the country’s first nuclear test, Laughing Buddha, as the spokesman of TBRL. However, he had never participated in its development.</p>

                        <h4>Death and Legacy</h4>
                        <p>Shillong, Meghalaya, on July 27, 2015.

                        The day we left a man who desired a miracle for India’s youth was a bad day for India. He falls inside the lecture hall only 5 minutes into it, about 6:35 p.m. In critical condition, he was brought to ‘Bethany Hospital.’ He was maintained in the intensive-care unit but showed no signs of life, and he was certified dead at 7:45 p.m. because of cardiac arrest.
                        
                        APJ Abdul Kalam is a very kind-hearted individual who generously performed many things for India. He is indeed the reason we have nuclear weapons today. He not only became President & did a lot of good for India, but he also made a significant contribution to missile history.</p>
